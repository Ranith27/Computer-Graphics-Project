# Computer-Graphics-Project
”FLAPPY BIRD” is implemented using OpenGL graphics package with
aid of C.This project demonstrates the Flappy Bird, which was a side-scrolling mobile
game featuring 2D retro style graphics. The objective is to direct a flying bird named
“Faby”, who moves continuously to the right, between sets of Mario-like pipes. If the bird
touches the pipe, they lose, Faby briefly flaps upwards each time the player presses the ’f’
or ’F’ key on the keyboard. If the key is not pressed, Faby falls because of gravity. Each
pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player a single point. The game keeps
track of the player’s score, awarding one point for each pair of pipes successfully navigated.
The player’s goal is to achieve the highest score possible by skillfully maneuvering Faby
through the gaps while avoiding collisions. The combination of retro-style 2D graphics
and intuitive controls makes for a challenging yet enjoyable gameplay that has captivated
millions of players worldwide.
